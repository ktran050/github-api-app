# Purpose

This is the assignment for Module 10 Lesson 6. This app will require not only using API's but passing headers and catching errors both with a .catch and by checking response.ok.
Users will be able to search a github user handle, have all repos associated with that handle listed (both repo name and URL). Making multiple searches will only show results for the current search.
